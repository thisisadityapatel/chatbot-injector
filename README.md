# chatbot-injector

Just a random javascript code that I had to make for a work project. Main Goal was to inject his code directly using inspect on the web page, delivered using a CDN, for testing the functionality on different platforms. Currntly not connected to any LLM backend, if you want you can just copy this, connect it to a backend LLM and it you should have you chatbot ready. Hope you know jQuery Ajax for that.
