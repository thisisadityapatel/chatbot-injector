# chatbot-injector

Just a random javascript code that I had to make for a work project. Main goal was to inject his code directly using inspect on the web page, delivered using a CDN (which currently isn't), for testing the functionality on different platforms. Currently not connected to any LLM backend websocket, if you want you can just copy this, connect it to a backend LLM websocket and it you should have a chatbot ready for any of your website. Hope you know jQuery Ajax for that.
